  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/2": "I have so much work to finish, but I really don't want to do it. Need help with anything?",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/3": "There's not much to do around here, especially when all the stores close.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/4": "The guards don't let us stay out too late because of the monsters. It's really annoying. You don't think you could sneak me out, could you?",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/5": "I wanted to hang out with the others today, but I didn't get the chance to. Are you free?",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/7": "I know it's dangerous at night, but at least it's quiet. It makes it easier to think about stuff, you know?",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/8": "... maybe I should fix my sleeping schedule. It's so late but I don't feel tired at all",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/9": "The sunset sure looks cool, don't you think? Like the sky was on fire… or something like that.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.evening/10": "Well, it's not too late for another stroll. There's not much else to do in a village, you know. Well, it probably beats sleeping next to creepers for all I know.",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/1": "*yawn* You're really up this late?",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/2": "A bit of a night owl, aren't you?",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/3": "You prefer the night too?",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/4": "Don't stray too far from the village. Wouldn't want you to get stuck out there with the monsters, would we?",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/5": "The guards always make the village feel safer, but it is still awfully eerie at night, isn't it?",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/6": "The darkness always makes me feel peaceful, it's a nice time to relax when the world is quiet.",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/7": "It's always so busy in the day time, so it is nice to go for a stroll when the stars are out.",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/8": "I'm getting really tired. I suppose it's been a long day, I might need to take it easier tomorrow.",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/9": "I can't wait to burrow underneath the covers.",
  "adult.dialogue.main.night/10": "You should really go to sleep. I hear you have a lot to do tomorrow.",
  "child.dialogue.main.night/1": "*yawn* Why are you up so late? It's so dark already.",
  "child.dialogue.main.night/2": "*yawn* Can't we talk some other time? I'm really, really, really sleepy.",
  "child.dialogue.main.night/3": "*just yawns and doesn't seem to quite notice you're there*",

  "teen.dialogue.main.night/2": "Go hunt those zombies outside or whatever you adventurers do. I'm trying to sleep.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/3": "Why are you in my house at this hour?",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/4": "Talk to me one more time, and I'm calling the guards. Git.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/5": "Look, I appreciate it and all, but some people are trying to sleep at this hour.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/6": "I don't mean to be mean or anything, but you should probably sleep too.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/7": "Shouldn't you be at your own place at this hour or something?.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/8": "We. Will. Talk. Later.",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/9": "*Snores*",
  "teen.dialogue.main.night/10": "*Clearly isn't asleep, but won't talk to you all the same.*",
  "cultist.dialogue.main/1": "There’s a lot you still have to learn.",
  "cultist.dialogue.main/2": "If you wonder how I have all these Sirben children then it’s a secret.",
  "cultist.dialogue.main/3": "Would you like to become one with the Sirbens..?",
  "guard.dialogue.main/1": "You need something?",
  "guard.dialogue.main/2": "I’m a little busy, please go bother someone else.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/3": "You look pretty strong.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/4": "I don’t like how quiet it is...",
  "guard.dialogue.main/5": "It’s a peaceful day, I hope it stays this peaceful.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/6": "You know, I once thought someone was attacking me, when I realise I'd hit an armour stand. Didn't make that mistake twice.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/7": "I don't know who you are, don't make me have to find out.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/8": "Staying safe, I hope.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/9": "I've always wondered how strong a rose gold sword would be.",
  "guard.dialogue.main/10": "Did you hear that? I'm sure there's something out there...",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/1": "Good morning, %1$s. Whatever you do today, please stay safe.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/2": "If there's one perk about being a guard, it's that you can rest when the sun is up. Unfortunately, it's not just monsters we have to worry about…",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/3": "You're not causing any trouble around here, are you?",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/4": "*Is clearly too focused on the patrol to notice you*",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/5": "Yes, I know there never are any monsters in the daytime… but I always can't help but see illagers in any bush I turn my head to. Maybe I really need a nap, after all…*",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/6": "Good morning, %1$s. Remember to make a report if you see anything suspicious, alright?",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/7": "When the last raid happened, it was because we didn't notice illager scouts. It won't ever happen again.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/8": "Oh, welcome, %1$s. Do you want to keep me company on my watch?.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/9": "Hello. You can feel safe now. There are no monsters during the day. Well, most of the time.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.morning/10": "You aren't doing anything suspicious, are you…? Oh, no, I'm only asking… just asking… hehehe….",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/1": "It's going to be nighttime soon. You should probably head indoors.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/2": "The setting sun sure looks beautiful… I just wish it didn't mean more monsters to deal with. Eh.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/3": "Just between you and me, I really wish I could just head home for the day and not worry about any zombies or skeletons.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/4": "It's evening already. I'm not sure if we should be talking right now...",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/5": "Guard duty isn't as depressing as some say. It's great if you need lots of time to think… not that I slack off at my post, gods forbid!",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/6": "I used to dream about being a guard when I was just a child, but a life of a guard isn't as grand as I thought. Then again, the more boring your job as a guard is, the better.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/7": "I used to go into the caves just like you, back when I was training to become a guard.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/8": "The monsters will come out any minute now. Head indoors if you don't want to have to fight them.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/9": "If you ever find yourself in trouble, just find me. I will do everything I can to help.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.evening/10": "Don't stray too far from the village if you're not well prepared, %1$s.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/1": "I just hate those zombies, and there's never an end to them!",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/2": "If you want to be helpful, you can watch here for the monsters with me.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/3": "... should I make another round, already?",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/4": "Make sure to watch out for these cursed creepers, %1$s.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/5": "I'm sometimes not sure what I hate more. Creepers, or skeletons?",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/6": "A few days ago, I had to put down a zombie that clearly wasn't gone far enough to be cured… moments like these haunt me when I try to sleep.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/7": "Make sure not to run in a straight line when you're facing a skeleton. Their arrows can be deadly.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/8": "... I hope there won't be a zombie siege tonight.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night/9": "I just want for this night to be finally over.",
  "guard.dialogue.main.night10": "Yes, we get scared too sometimes, but bravery isn't the lack of fear, it's the ability to control it for the greater cause. Now that I'm afraid. What?",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.morning/1": "Another morning, another day spent in the fields.",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.morning/2": "It's hard work to be a farmer, but it really pays off.",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.morning3": "One perk of being a farmer: it's up to you what food you get to eat later!",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.evening/1": "It was yet another productive day in the fields. I think I deserve some rest, now.",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.evening/2": "I love being a farmer, but it's hard on you. I'm really glad whenever the day's over and I can just relax.",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.evening/3": "I hope nothing is trampling my fields right now…",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.night/1": "*Yawns* Tomorrow will be another day of hard work in the fields. I need all the rest I can get..",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.night/2": "My body feels so sore after today… I feel like I can sleep like a log…",
  "farmer.dialogue.main.night/3": "You should probably sleep, too. And since it's my job to feed everyone in the village, I don't think I should be talking to you this late, either.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.morning/1": "I'm sure the smell of fresh meat will lighten up the day for everyone.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.morning/2": "There's more to my work than just killing pigs, you know. I'm working just as hard as anyone in the village.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.morning/3": "Mmm. This meat looks so good I'd like to have some myself.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.evening/1": "Well, that was a productive day. I've sure fed lots of people in the village.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.evening/2": "I'm not really at work right now, but if you've got the money and want some quality, fresh meat, I'm still up for some trading.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.evening/3": "I should probably make sure the animals breed tomorrow, I've been starting to run low… huh? Were you saying something?",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.night/1": "I should probably be in bed. People will want to buy some quality meat early tomorrow, and so I can't act be acting like a night owl.",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.night/2": "Huh? What? Do you want to buy some pork at this hour? Are you really serious?",
  "butcher.dialogue.main.night/3": "The butcher's work might not look tough, but darn, my body really is sore all over. I really need to go to sleep.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.morning/1": "Ugh, I'm so tired. Then again, I can't just sleep in, or my animals will go hungry..",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.morning/2": "Huh? Can't wait it a little? I'm… *yawn* still so sleepy. My sheep kept me up at night far too long…",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.morning/3": "Work with wool can be a bit tiring sometimes, but it sure is rewarding. I'm speaking from experience!.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.evening/1": "What? Time off? Well, I still need to feed the sheep before I go to bed, but I guess I'm kind of free, now.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.evening/2": "If you want to trade some wool, now it would be good time to do it. I finally have some more time on my hands.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.evening/3": "Don't tell anyone… but I really like mutton. Roast mutton, minced mutton, muttons steak… just don't mention it near the sheep!",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.night/1": "I really hope my sheep are quiet today. Maybe I'll catch some good sleep..",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.night/2": "I should call it a night. I need to get up early to feed my animals.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.night/3": "Isn't there some better time for us to trade? I'm sure you can find some better time to sell me wool. *Yawn.*.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.night/4": "Having trouble falling asleep? Try counting sheep.",
  "shepherd.dialogue.main.night/5": "Finally I've caught that runaway sheep!",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.morning/1": "When fishing, it's always best to start early in the day. That's how you get the most out of the day!",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.morning/2": "Do you have some materials to spare? Believe it or not,  but fishing rods don't last that long…",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.morning/3": "I sometimes feel sorry for these poor fish, but it's up to all of us to feed the village. It's in the cycle of nature.",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.evening/1": "It was a day well spent! Would you believe how many catches I've got?!.",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.evening/2": "I'm not really on the clock right now, but if you have some quality fish to sell, then hit me with it. I'm always open to a good trade!",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.evening/3": "No, I didn't become a fisherman because I liked fish. … I do like fish, though. Who doesn't? It's definitely not as heavy on stomach as pork or beef.",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.night/1": "Hum? How can I help you? Sorry, but I really need to get to bed, or I will have a bad day fishing tomorrow…",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.night/2": "What…? Don't tell me you've hit me up at this hour just to sell fish…?",
  "fisherman.dialogue.main.night/3": "I know fishing might not look too hard, but I'm really tired after fishing up till the afternoon. Can't we talk tomorrow?",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.morning/1": "Good morning, %1$s! Do you happen to be in need of some new, quality tools?!",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.morning/2": "It's sometimes hard to get myself to be fully awake, but then I always remind myself that the village relies on the tools I make. So, I can't allow myself to be lazy.",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.morning/3": "Do you happen to have some quality materials on hand? I could really use some.",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.evening/1": "Phew, that was a full day of work. It always makes me proud to see people use my tools, though",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.evening/2": "Yes, I'm technically off the clock now, but if you want to trade for a bit, I'm still open. I didn't get entirely sold out.",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.evening/3": "I love to make tools, but what I love even more is to get to just relax after a full day of work!",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.night/1": "I should be in bed already. Tools take time to make, so I unfortunately can't afford sleep in too much.",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.night/2": "Huh? Why are you here at this hour? Don't tell me you want to buy tools so late!",
  "toolsmith.dialogue.main.night/3": "Can't we talk later? It might not look hard, but I'm actually tired after today's toolsmithing work…",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.morning/1": "I'm proud of my work, but gods, isn't it tough to work all day by this damned blast furnace…",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.morning/2": "If you happen to have some resources you'd be willing to sell, I would be really grateful. It can be difficult to get my own sometimes.",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.morning/3": "It's so hot in here. I really wish I could just go outside today.",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.evening/1": "I take a lot of pride in being an armorer. It takes a lot of skill to create quality armor.",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.evening/2": "I'm technically not on the job right now, but yes, I have some pieces of armor if you want to buy any. I never get fully sold out..",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.evening/3": "I take pride in my job, but I'm glad to be away from that scorching hot blast furnace. It almost makes me want to jump into powder snow. Almost.",
  "armorer.dialogue.main.night/1": "Can't we talk anytime later? I need to sleep. A tired blacksmith is a bad blacksmith..",

  "child.dialogue.chat.taiga/1": "Did you see the foxes? I really want one as a pet, but they are so fast. Can you catch one for me?",

  "adult.dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/3": "In weather like this, it's perfect for snuggling myself in a blanket reading a book by the furnace!",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/4": "When it snows here, it takes me back to my childhood where me and a couple of friends would have snowball fights. I really miss those times.",

  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/4": "At night it's very scenic and cooler, very nice to look at the stars.",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/5": "Phew! Never thought I'd say this, but the sun is pretty bad today.",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/6": "Phew! The sun is pretty bad today!",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/7": "Have you found any rabbits? They're hard to see here!",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/8": "One downside about living here are the husks. No matter what, you get super hungry when they smack you! What gives!?",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/9": "Pricked myself on a cactus the other day. Gotta mind your step around here!",
  "adult.dialogue.chat.desert/10": "Life in the dry desert is not easy, but at least we have this village where we can get water and food.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.success/1": "Cool! I'll explore the world too, one day!.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.success/2": "Wow! It must be amazing to just get to travel and explore. I love my village, family and friends, but listening to you really makes me feel jealous!",

  "dialogue.story.exploring.fail/2": "Wow. Don't cut yourself on that edge, tough guy.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.fai/l3": "Talking to you feels like talking to a child who they want to be when they grow up. Without the adorable part, that is.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/1": "Is it that hot there?!",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/2": "Wow, how have you even managed to survive in such a treacherous place? I'm impressed.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/3": "I've heard there is lots of treasure in the Nether for those brave enough to go there. If only I were brave enough to try and set foot in the Nether…",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/4": "You must be really brave to go there. Aren't you scared when you go? N-Not that I would be…",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/5": "Have you seen a Zombified Piglin?",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/1": "I don't think you've ever set foot into the Nether.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/2": "... now I get why those Piglins attacked you.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/3": "I don't care if you've been to the Nether. You couldn't tell a story to save your life.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/4": "... you don't look nearly strong enough to go to the Nether.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/5": "My grandpa used to explore the Nether, and he never told me about warped fungus. You liar!",
  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.success/1": "Incredible! And did you bring the dragon egg with you?",
  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.success/2": "Oh my! Have you really killed the mighty dragon of legend?! The village will sing of your endeavors for generations!",
  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.fail/1": "Hah! Have you gone nuts?. The ender dragon is a myth.",
