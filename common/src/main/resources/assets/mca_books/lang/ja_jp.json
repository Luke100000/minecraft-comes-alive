  "mca.books.death.1": "§f§l墓§r§f\n§r§f村人が死んだ時、その死体は一番近い墓に埋められる。したがって、墓地の区画に空きを作るのを忘れてはならない。",
  "mca.books.death.2": "§f§l死神の召喚§r§f\n残念なことだが、死を打ち負かせるものは、死そのもの──死神だけだ。奴を呼び出すには、２ブロック以上の高さの黒曜石の柱３本からなる祭壇をる必要がある。仰々しいのがお好みなら、柱はもっと高くても構わない。",
  "mca.books.death.3": "§f§l死神の召喚２§r§f\n祭壇の中央には、生贄としてエメラルドブロックを置く。",
  "mca.books.death.4": "§f§l死神の召喚 3§r§f\n祭壇が完成したら、夜まで待つのだ。夜闇の中、3本の柱に火をつける。戦う心構えができているのなら、エメラルドブロックに火をつけ......逃げるのだ!!",
  "mca.books.death.5": "§f§lFighting Grim§r§f\nGrim is tough. Use full diamond armor, lots of potions, and lots of enchantments. He can:\n- Fly\n- Block attacks\n- Blind you\n- Move your items\n- Teleport",
  "mca.books.death.6": "§f§l死神との戦い 2§r§f\nもし死神が防御態勢になっている間に攻撃すると、死神は背後に瞬間移動して攻撃してくる。弓矢、毒を使ってみようなどと考えないほうがいい。奴は完璧に耐性をつけている。",
  "mca.books.death.7": "§f§l死神との戦い 3§r§f\n体力を大きく減らした死神は、空中へ瞬間移動し、回復を始める。その間、奴は冥界から手下を呼び出し、君を攻撃させる。",
  "mca.books.death.8": "§f§l死神との戦い 4§r§f\n回復を終えた死神は、君への攻撃を続ける。だが、奴は3分半はもう一度回復することができないし、攻撃される前の体力にまでは回復できない。",
  "mca.books.death.9": "§f§l死神の鎌§r§f\n死神に致命傷を与えると、奴は鎌を落とし、奈落へと帰っていく。氷のように冷たい死神の鎌は、強力な道具である。誰か他の村人を鎌で倒すと、魂を刈り取ることができる。その魂を、墓石に移すのだ。",
  "mca.books.death.10": "§f§l死神の鎌 2§r§f\nしかし、君の友人は地下で過ごした時間のために、感染した状態で目覚めるだろう。治す方法はある。確か我が友リチャードがこのことについて本を書いていたと思う。",

  "mca.books.romance.0": "§lIntroduction§r\nInteraction is key to building relationships and finding the love of your life. I've happily written this book in order to share my knowledge of interaction, love, and, unfortunately, divorce, to anyone who may need a little push in the right direction.",
  "mca.books.romance.1": "§lPersonalities§r\nWhen speaking to any villager, you'll notice they have a personality. Pay close attention to this! Some people like jokes more, some love a hug. Some personalities are more obvious than others. Hover over the personality to see some hints.",
  "mca.books.romance.2": "§lMoods§r\nEvery person has a mood, which is always apparent when speaking to them. Moods can change throughout the day, and determine how likely a villager is to like certain interactions.",
  "mca.books.romance.3": "§lMoods 2§r\nThe death of a villager seems to put those nearby in bad moods. Taxing also gradually decreases the moods of everyone. Gifts and successful interactions are known to boost moods.",
  "mca.books.romance.4": "§lInteracting§r\nChoose wisely when interacting with a villager, based on their mood and personality! If choosing a romantic interaction, be sure that the villager you are talking to likes you a lot.",
  "mca.books.romance.5": "§lInteracting pt. 2§r\nDon't be annoying! Talking to someone for too long will bore them, and your interactions may stop succeeding. If this happens, simply wait some time before trying to talk to them again.",
  "mca.books.romance.6": "§lGifts§r\nGifts are another great way to win someone's friendship. But again, be careful who you gift what. A fisherman loves fish, but oh my, don't ever gift a smelly fish to a noble lady.",
  "mca.books.romance.7": "§lMarriage§r\nTo get married, simply gift a villager a wedding ring once you feel you have reached the highest relationship level.",
  "mca.books.romance.8": "§lDivorce§r\nUnfortunately, sometimes it is best to split from your spouse and move on. To do this, look for a cleric to get divorce papers. Then talk to your spouse.",

  "mca.books.family.2": "§lGrowth§r\nBabies take time to grow, make sure to hold them until they are ready, or give them to your spouse to take care of. Once a baby is ready to grow, you may place it on the ground and it will grow into a child!",
  "mca.books.family.3": "§lAdolescence§r\nChildren will grow slowly. However, the magical properties of Golden Apples are said to accelerate any child's growth. I have yet to try this myself.",
  "mca.books.family.4": "§lChores§r\nAny child can farm, cut wood, mine, hunt, and fish. You'll need to provide them with the tools they need to do so. If a tool breaks and the child doesn't have another, they will have no choice but to stop working.",

  "mca.books.rose_gold.1": "Ah, rose gold - a lovely combination of silver, copper, and gold that smelts into a pinkish-orange metal. Most use it as an alternative to gold for crafting rings as it is much less expensive. However, it has some interesting qualities that are easy to miss.",
  "mca.books.rose_gold.2": "§lCreating Dust§r\nRose gold, once smelted, can be crushed into a fine dust. Look closely at rose gold dust in bright light, and you'll see shiny flecks of pure gold!§r",
  "mca.books.rose_gold.3": "§lWashing Dust§r\nWith a little work, we can extract the gold from the dust and create pure gold ingots. Simply mix the dust with a bucket of water. The lighter silver and copper components will wash away, leaving you with about 6 smaller piles of gold dust.",
  "mca.books.rose_gold.4": "§lExtracting Gold§r\nArrange 9 piles of dust on your crafting table, and if you're lucky, you'll find a gold nugget in one of them!§rAnd of course, once you have 9 gold nuggets, you'll be able to craft them into a solid gold ingot.",

  "mca.books.infection.2": "§lCuring§r\nContrary to popular belief, any infected villager can be cured. Gift a villager a golden apple to cure an ongoing infection. If the infection turned the villager into a zombie already you must first weaken the zombie with a potion, then apply the golden apple.",
  "mca.books.infection.3": "§lCuring 2§r\nAny other zombies you see unfortunately are too far gone, and cannot be cured.",
  "mca.books.infection.4": "§lCuring 3§r\nZombies will take a couple of minutes to be fully cured. Villagers who were recently infected, though, and haven't had time to degrade into a full zombie, will be cured instantly!",
  "mca.books.infection.5": "§lWarnings§r\nVillagers are highly susceptible to infection, decrease the risk of infection by building an infirmary!",

  "mca.books.blueprint.1": "§fOn your journey, you probably come across several villages full of small, impractical, and barely decorated. How should a village ever evolve into something bigger?",
  "mca.books.blueprint.2": "§f§lBlueprint§r§f\nThat's why I'm wandering across the planet, helping villages I encounter on my travels. And you could too! Craft yourself a blueprint using blue dye and paper and check out the catalog of buildings every village needs but can't build on their own.",
  "mca.books.blueprint.3": "§f§lRequirements§r§f\nA buildings usually requires a minimum size. You can't just plug everything into a shed. Then you have to make sure that all the block requirements are fulfilled.",

  "mca.books.cult_0.0": "A long time ago, a being from another world came to this planet, sharing its wisdom as it travels across the land… This entity was called Sirben the 99.",
  "mca.books.cult_0.1": "Despite good intentions, its knowledge was too much for our minds to comprehend, some people didn't listen, but those who did were changed, to never be the same again…",
  "mca.books.cult_0.2": "Their minds, shattered by the truths Sirben said, became obsessed, and they passed “the sacred words” on to the next generations. Everyone who gains this erratic behavior receives the “Sirben” trait.",
  "mca.books.cult_0.3": "Until this day, some people say they still can hear its whispers…",
  "mca.books.cult_1.author": "Evelyn the Seeker",
  "mca.books.cult_1.0": "The Sirben cult speaks of a higher power that transcends our world, a being that exists beyond our understanding of time and space.",
  "mca.books.cult_1.1": "Through meditation and ritual, cultists attempt to commune with this entity, hoping to gain insight into its unknowable nature and the secrets of the universe.",
  "mca.books.cult_1.2": "But with this knowledge comes a price - a madness that grips the mind and twists the soul. Those who follow Sirben's teachings must tread carefully, lest they lose themselves in the pursuit of forbidden truths.",
  "mca.books.cult_1.3": "Yet even as the world scoffs at their beliefs, the cultists remain steadfast in their devotion. For they know that beyond the veil of reality lies a realm of infinite wonder, where the mysteries of the cosmos are laid bare for those with the courage to seek them.",

  "mca.books.cult_2.1": "That's right, you must milk a goat at midnight in the middle of a snowstorm! It sounds strange, but it's the only way to wake the ancient cultists from their slumber.",
  "mca.books.cult_2.2": "But be careful, for these undead cultists are not to be taken lightly. They may be aggressive towards you once awakened, and will stop at nothing to protect their secrets.",
  "mca.books.cult_2.3": "If you're brave enough to face them, though, there's a chance they'll drop the secret words of the Sirbens upon their defeat. And with those words, you'll unlock a new level of understanding about the mysteries of this world and beyond.",
